					<h2>Air Jordan XI</h2>
					<p>Due to Michael Jordan's first retirement from the NBA in 1993, Nike had plans to discontinue his signature line after the Air Jordan X. However, while everyone else at Nike assumed the line was over, Tinker Hatfield was hard at work behind the scenes crafting the Air Jordan XI in hopes that MJ would someday make a return to the court—a gamble that paid off handsomely for the designer. While the Air Jordan XI's on-court legacy was established by MJ himself, one of the first detailed glimpses at the sneakers came courtesy of then-sideline reporter Ahmad Rashad. While highlighting MJ's new black XIs (which would later become known as the "Space Jam" colorway), Rashad joked that he was taking home His Airness' old shoes: the "Concord" Jordan XI. The Air Jordan XI made its on-court debut during the 1995 NBA Playoffs, but it wasn't until the next season that the shoe's legacy really began to unfold. MJ donned the sneakers throughout the entire '95-96 campaign, leading the Bulls to a historic 72-10 regular season record, which Jordan Brand commemorated in 2015 with the colorway pictured above. He also rocked them throughout the 1996 Playoffs, where Chicago would ultimately capture its first ring since Jordan's return to the hardwood.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan I</h2>
					<p>What started it all, the Original Air Jordan 1 (I) Black Red released in 1985. The nicknamed Banned was given to the OG Air Jordan 1 Black / Red because David Stern said the colorway did not match league regulations.
          Every time Michael Jordan wore the Original Air Jordan 1 Black / Red he was finned $5,000, and Nike would pay the debt in full. What Stern did not know, this would cause a backwards affect. Since the NBA Banned the OG Air Jordan 1 (I) Black / Red, this made a frenzy for what many have said was the beginning stages of the sneaker culture.
          Prices for the Original Air Jordan 1 (I) Black / Red have gone up tremendously. A deadstock pair with box and hang tag can sell between $1,500 and $2,000.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan XII</h2>
					<p>The Air Jordan 12 is Michael Jordan’s twelfth signature shoe. It debuted in 1996 and was designed by Tinker Hatfield. The shoe is inspired by the “Rising Sun” flag of Japan and features a mix of leather, carbon fiber, and Zoom Air. Several mid and low-top models have been released with leather and nubuck. Jordan’s 1996–97 season is one for the history books. In Game 5 of The Finals, MJ put on a legendary performance, scoring 38 points, grabbing seven rebounds and handing out five assists while suffering a 103-degree temperature against the Utah Jazz. MJ would ultimately lead his team to yet another title. Similar to MJ’s enduring drive, the technology and construction of the Air Jordan XII helped solidify it as one of the most durable Air Jordans of all time. And like Michael’s own style, the design of the shoe communicated a bold and striking elegance.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan III</h2>
					<p>The Air Jordan III is Michael Jordan's third signature basketball shoe. It released in 1988 in four colorways of white, black, red, and blue. It was the first Air Jordan to feature visible Air, elephant print, and the Jumpman logo. With MJ’s second slam dunk contest win, this time wearing AJ III White Cements, came an inspiring and memorable image of flight. And with it, another icon is born — the Jumpman. Here, and with the help of his MVP nomination and a certain Mars Blackmon, Michael Jordan and his sleek footwear are shuttled to fame. What is now one of the sneaker world’s most notable silhouettes was brought to life with an architect’s keen eye. Tinker Hatfield, the auspicious name behind much of the Air Jordan franchise, was the visionary behind this classic. At the request of MJ, Hatfield developed the now iconic elephant print.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan IV</h2>
					<p>For just three seconds, all Cleveland had to do was lock down Michael Jordan. They believed they had the players to do it, too.
          Up 100-99 with three seconds left, Cleveland should have taken down Chicago in Round 1 of the 1989 Playoffs. In fact, they beat Chicago all six times during the regular season. Yet Cleveland’s dominance began to crumble, as the two, chippy Eastern Conference rivals battled back and forth in the first round. It all came down to a fifth, deciding game to determine who would move on.
          At home on May 7 for Game 5, in front of a raucous crowd, they enforced their will on Chicago. Of course, MJ’s teammates did not back down. In the final three minutes, the lead changed six times. With Cleveland down 99-98, an acrobatic layup gave them back the lead. It looked like Cleveland had won it, and that the game had its hero.
          Except there were still three seconds left. During the timeout, a play was drawn up for the Chicago center to take the last shot, thinking that the defense wouldn’t expect it. MJ, of course, was furious. He slapped the clipboard and insisted the ball come to him. A new play was drawn up for MJ to get the inbound pass. As they walked onto the floor, MJ told a teammate that he was making that shot. No matter the outcome, he’d be wearing a black and red sneaker called the Air Jordan IV, which had been elevating his game for half of the ‘88-’89 season. He’d first laced up the new model for the NBA All-Star Game on February 12, 1989 in Houston, Texas, and it was also the first global release for an Air Jordan model. Through three defenders, the in-bounder made a perfect pass to MJ. He caught the ball, dribbled twice towards the foul line and leapt into the air. He floated just long enough to prevent the defender from blocking his shot, pumping in the air and letting the ball fly just as the buzzer sounded. You know the rest: The Shot. Ballgame. Fist pumps. All eyes were on Jordan as he continued to rise. The Air Jordan 4 debuted in 1989 and was designed by Tinker Hatfield. It features lightweight netting and plastic wings on the upper as well as visible Max Air. The original colorways of the Air Jordan 4 are 'White/Cement,' 'Bred,' 'Military,' and 'Fire Red.' The Retro 4 was also featured in Spike Lee's movie "Do the right thing" which helped the shoe become an iconic pair in the African American community.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan V</h2>
					<p>The Air Jordan 5 is Michael Jordan’s fifth signature basketball shoe. It was designed by Tinker Hatfield and released in 1990. The original versions featured “Nike Air” on the heel, but more recent versions have a Jumpman logo. The AJ5 was part of the first “Remastered” releases that debuted in late 2014/early 2015. Read the articles below to learn more. In his 1989 — 1990 season, it was clear that MJ was better than ever. Setting a points per game personal record, he drained 69 points against Cleveland. He hit 92 three-pointers, compared to only 68 in all prior seasons combined. Every aspect of MJ’s game was flawless, but it was his dogfight-like flight that separated him from every other player on the planet. Tinker Hatfield took inspiration from Jordan’s biting style and, likening it to an American WWII fighter plane, he designed the Air Jordan V with shark-tooth shapes on the midsole. Paired with a clear outsole, the shoe a imbued a ferocity reminiscent of its relentless muse.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan XIII</h2>
					<p>Michael Jordan’s creative dexterity and stealth put his opponents on edge and threw them off balance, earning him the infamous nickname “Black Cat”. Throughout the 1997–98 season Jordan consistently outmaneuvered his rivals with a remarkable deftness all his own. Appropriately inspired by a panther’s predatory nature, Tinker harnessed its tenacity to create the Air Jordan XIII. The shoe featured an unconventional holographic eye and an outsole resembling a panther paw. The AJ XIII also featured innovations like a carbon fiber plate and Zoom Air, to give players the agility of a cat.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan VI</h2>
					<p>In 1991, Michael Jordan wore the Air Jordan 6 while completing his second MVP season. He locked in another scoring title and hoisted the NBA championship trophy for the first time in his illustrious career. Tinker Hatfield designed two grip holes into the rubber tongue to help people slip their feet in more easily and included a translucent sole, which contrasted the colored midsole. This proved to be an essential detail once the famous “Infrared” colorway hit the streets. Originally released the year MJ won his first professional championship, the Air Jordan 6 Retro SP features a sculpted midsole for cushioned stability, with overlays designed to abstractly depict the number 23. Dual Nike Air units and a foam midsole provide lightweight, responsive cushioning. The shoe became iconic on June 5, 1991, in the fourth quarter of Game 2 between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers, Jordan drove down the court and threw a no-look pass to teammate Cliff Levingston, who made a move to the basket from the left wing. But when the defense collapsed on him, Levingston kicked the ball back to the top of the key, where Jordan stood, ready to take flight. With the lane as clear as the Red Sea before Moses, Jordan took one left-handed dribble toward the hoop and powerfully leaped into the air with the basketball extended in front of him. His Airness was destined to throw down a tomahawk jam, but when his former University of North Carolina teammate, Lakers big man Sam Perkins, appeared in his sight, Jordan completely flipped the script. In midair, he switched the ball from his right hand to his left, and instead of a dunk, he finished the sequence with an acrobatic layup off the glass. The play, known simply as “The Move,” sent the Chicago Stadium crowd and the game's broadcasting crew into a frenzy.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan XIV</h2>
					<p>The Air Jordan 14 is Michael Jordan’s fourteenth signature shoe. It originally released in 1998, boasting a Ferrari influenced design that served as an homage to Michael Jordan’s love for motorsports. The most beloved colorway of this late-era Tinker Hatfield model was the “Last Shot,” a black/red pair made famous by MJ during that iconic moment where he hit the winning shot in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals to win the Championship. It was Michael Jordan’s last shot as a Bull, that jumper over Bryon Russell in the dying seconds of Game 6 of the NBA Finals against the Jazz in 1998 in Salt Lake City. Jordan’s last shot as a Bull, his last basket, his last game and, most notably, his and the franchise’s last championship, the three-peat repeat. Several colorways later followed including “Black Toe,” “Candy Cane,” and “Indiglo.” The “Last Shot” colorway is expected to release again in June 2018. Read the articles below for further release details and price information.</p>

					<h2>Air Jordan VII</h2>
					<p>The Air Jordan 7 is Michael Jordan’s seventh signature basketball shoe. It originally released in 1992, and MJ won his second consecutive NBA Championship in this sneaker.
          The Air Jordan VII was the shoe worn by MJ on his way to becoming a international icon. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Portland Trail Blazers, he was an absolute assassin from behind the arc. Jordan — a career 32.7 percent 3-point shooter who shot a mere 27 percent during the 1991-92 regular season — dropped six deep balls in the first half alone, tying a Finals record for 3s in a half, set by Michael Cooper in 1987 and tied by Bill Laimbeer in 1990. After connecting on his sixth 3-pointer of the night, which he swished over his defender Cliff Robinson, Jordan turned to the scorer’s table and shook his head three times. Then, as he jogged back down the court, he employed a simple shrug of his shoulders. Not only did he repeat as a NBA champion, Finals MVP and MVP during the regular season, he also led the USA to a gold medal at the 1992 summer games in Barcelona. As MJ’s prominence rose, the AJ VII steered the Air Jordan line in a new direction. In an effort to distinguish Air Jordan from Nike as a whole, the shoe saw two daring omissions by design — exterior Nike branding and a visible Air window. Foreshadowing even bigger changes to come, the Air Jordan line now began to be marketed separately from Nike Basketball. The original colorways include the “True Red/Raptors,” “Hare,” “Cardinal,” and “Bordeaux.” Read the articles below for more release details and price information.</p>
